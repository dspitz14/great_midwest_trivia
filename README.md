# Great Midwest Trivia Contest Data Analysis

Each year, The Great Midwest Trivia Contest generates a surprisingly large amount of data. The data's structure varies year-to-year and always has weird quirks to it. This is an attempt to make sense of it all and uniformly store the data.

I'm also using the data to learn more about areas of data science I am particularly interested in. Currently, I'm learning about NLP and using the question text as a data source.

If you have any more trivia-related data you'd like to contribute, feel free to reach out!
